Are you a developer seeking practical, up-to-date insights into designing scalable and resilient microservices? _Microservices Design Patterns in .NET, Second Edition_ provides a comprehensive exploration of modern microservices using C# 14 and .NET 10.</br>
This edition expands on core patterns such as CQRS, event sourcing, and Saga, while introducing advanced concepts such as observability with OpenTelemetry, zero-trust security, and container-based workflows.</br>
You’ll explore both synchronous and asynchronous communication, apply domain-driven design to define service boundaries, and manage data consistency using proven persistence strategies. The book also guides you through container hosting, serverless functions, and production-ready deployment pipelines.</br>
By the end of this book, you’ll know how to design and deploy secure, maintainable, and resilient microservices that fit perfectly in modern cloud ecosystems.</details>
